## My first steps into GraphQL

Welcome, in this repo I'll be practicing with graphql, I don't have any idea concrete
in my mind to put it to the test but I think I'll make a simple GraphQL 
query exercise, involving a simple mysql database.

I'm not developing an UI for this also, so It's just pure graphql practice

Maybe even after using mysql, I cant start using mongo db here
